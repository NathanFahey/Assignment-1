		<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">My interest in IT started about 10 years ago when I first started playing Minecraft after 
		a friend had recommended the game to me. After being swiftly hooked on the game, constantly
		playing the vanilla version was getting stale and repetitive so I started becoming more interested 
		in the mods available for download from the internet for Minecraft. This involved modifying files 
		and programs on my computer, something which I had never done before but I found fascinating and 
		rewarding. I became proficient in using computers and I gained sufficient knowledge during
		IT/Computing classes at school and enjoying making more complex programs and games than my peers. 
		IT has always been my favourite subject at school which lead to my decision to do a Bachelor of IT.
		I was not sure what job I wanted or what university course I wanted to study so I chose IT because 
		it is my biggest interest.</p>
		<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">I chose to come to RMIT because it is a great school for technology-based courses which is 
		obviously important when doing a Bachelor of IT. The ATAR entry score was close to my ATAR score 
		so going to RMIT was the RMIT was my first choice for university, so I was excited to be accepted.</p>
		<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">At RMIT I expect to learn the necessary skills required to have a job in the IT industry. 
		These skills include being proficient in multiple programming languages and having detailed knowledge of 
		the workings of IT systems and databases.</p>

		<h2><u>Ideal Job</u></h2>
		<p class="paragraph"> <a href="https://bit.ly/2P810VV">Link to job on Seek.com.au</a></p>
		<img src="JobScreenshot.jpg", width="600px">
		<p class="paragraph">The position is a full-time software engineer/developer at Vanderlande’s Melbourne office. 
		It involves making software through writing code, testing it then installing and configuring that 
		code. Other responsibilities include maintaining and optimising current control software used at 
		Vanderlande’s warehouses; developing and implementing database programs using Oracle which 
		obviously requires prior knowledge of Oracle. The role does not just include programming and
		implementing software, there is also responsibility for helping repair software malfunctions
		on the clients end as well as being available to help the clients in any tech issues or queries 
		that may arise. My favourite part about IT is programming which is a major part of this job, making
		it a large reason why this job is appealing to me.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">There are many qualifications required to have before applying for this job. The applicant 
		needs to have at least 2 years in SQL (Structured Query Language) and Java or .NET. Expert
		knowledge of the functions of Oracle as well as procedures, triggers, packages and performance
		tuning are necessary. Other qualifications are: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ability to performance tune SQL programs</li>
			<li>Experience with DBA</li>
			<li>Experience with tracking tools such as JIRA and Git version control</li>
			<li>Fluent English Speaker</li>
			<li>Willing to spend 25% of their job travelling</li>
			<li>Full Australian Working Right</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What skills do I currently have?</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">I currently have few skills and little to no qualifications and experience. 
		I know a medium amount of python as that was the main programming language I used for Year 12 Software 
		Development as well as knowing lesser amounts of html and visual basic that I learnt during high school.</p>
		<h3>How do you plan to get the skills required for the position?</h3>
		<p class="paragraph"> I plan to obtain skills such as extensive knowledge of python and html 
		throughout my time at RMIT as they will be required for many jobs in the IT industry. However, 
		for the position at Vanderlande my goal is to obtain at least 2 years of experience in SQL and Java.
		SQL is the focus of the subject Practical Database concepts which I am currently studying in my 
		course. I plan to study SQL and Java by both borrowing library books that contain vast amounts of 
		information as well taking online courses from websites such as ‘codacademy’ and ‘scrimba’.</p>

		<h2><u>Personal Profile</u></h2>
		<h3>Results of a Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
		<img src="Personality-Test-Picture.jpg", width="400px">
		<h3>Online Learning Style Test:</h3>
		<p>My Scores:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Auditory: 15%</li>
			<li>Visual: 45%</li>
			<li>Tactile: 40%</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The result of my test means I predominantly a visual learner. The test provided the following 
		information; If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand 
		and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn
		best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.</p>
		<h3>Job Outlook Test</h3>
		<p>Matching Work Styles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>33% Analytical </li>
			<li>26% Administrative </li>
			<li>20% Creative </li>
			<li>20% Practical </li>
			<li>0% Enterprising </li>
			<li>0% Helping</li>

			<li>Environmental Scientist</li>
			<li>Surverying and Spatial Science Technician</li>
			<li>Archaeologists</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">These test results indicate that I am a very introverted and observant person. 
		This means that I enjoy my own company more than the company of others and like staying home more than 
		going out and partying. Being observant means I am more likely to notice intricate details than other 
		people who may miss them. I am also a visual learner which means I learn best by watching videos and
		picturing the information in my head. I am also analytical and administrative meaning I work well 
		behind the scenes assessing and organizing information.</p>
		<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">My introversion means that working in a team will be difficult for me and 
		effective communication is a skill that I have little of. Being a thinker means that I am more 
		likely to work slowly and think of a smart solution to a problem rather than rushing through it 
		and making mistakes. My work style is 0% helping meaning I do not want to work in a job interacting 
		with and helping other people, I would rather sit in an office by myself. This ties in with the 
		lack of effective communication skills.</p>
		<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">When forming a team, I should join with people who are more extraverted 
		and have much better communication skills. This will make it easier for myself to communicate 
		with them and will help improve my communication skills in general. Being a visual learner means 
		it will be more helpful if other members in my group shared images of their progress rather than 
		simply using words.</p>

		<h2><u>Project Idea</u></h2>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>Overview: My project idea is a mobile app that has maths games for kids to help them become 
		better at maths. These maths games will include minigames that require the user quickly answer 
		several addition, subtraction, multiplication and division questions. The user will answer maths 
		questions that have different difficulties, and their statistics (how many questions they have 
		correctly answered) will be saved in the app. The idea behind the app is to develop fast thinking
		skills when solving maths questions for the students while allowing the students to have fun at 
		the same time.</p>
		<h3>Motivation</h3>
		<p>The idea for this project came about when I was searching for information technology project ideas 
		on google. I found a website that had a list of educational app ideas for students. I decided to do 
		this type of project because it reminded me of when I was in primary school and I used 
		less practical multiplication cards. Cards can be easily lost and often require 
		additional help usually from the child’s parent to test the child.
		Developing an app that is simple for students to learn maths equations and fun as well will be 
		an advancement from using cards.</p>
		<h3>Details</h3>
		<p>The app will be a maths app that will be available on mobile phones and it will be aimed towards 
		primary school students. The app will quickly show maths questions to the user and the user will 
		type in their answer as a timer counts down. The app will be designed to be colourful to look at 
		and a fun way for the user to learn. This is because the app is for kids who generally have short 
		attention spans and if the app was boring to use then kids won’t be inspired to learn maths. 
		Questions will pop up on the screen and if the user answers a question incorrectly, they are told 
		the answer. They then have as much time as they need to press the button to move to the next 
		question while they think about why they got the last question wrong.</p>
		<p>There will be four maths categories of questions which are addition, subtraction, 
		multiplication and division. Each category will have three difficulty settings which will be 
		easy, medium and hard. Difficulty settings will be aimed at age groups because younger children
		will be new to learning maths and therefore require easier questions. The easy questions will
		contain one-digit numbers (e.g. 3x2 or 9-4), medium questions will contain two-digit numbers
		(e.g. 12x11 or 89+75) the hard questions will contain much larger three-digit numbers 
		(e.g. 202x4 or 118+296). Older students using the app will find the hard questions more applicable 
		to them but if they are not proficient with maths then they will be able to do the medium or easy 
		questions instead. For the easy questions there will be a timer of 10 seconds which will allow the 
		user time to think will also promoting quick problem solving. The timer for the medium difficulty 
		questions will be 25 seconds and 45 seconds for the hard questions.</p>
		<p>Once the user has selected a difficulty they will be brought to a screen where they choose the 
		maths category they would like to answer questions in. There will be an order of recommendation 
		for each maths category which from left to right will be addition, subtraction, multiplication 
		then division. Categories can be chosen whenever the user wants but they will likely gravitate 
		towards answering each category from left to right. Once the user has correctly completed 50 
		questions in a category they will then be recommended to switch to the next category as they are 
		now proficient enough in their current category. Users will be required to use an account to 
		login so their progress will be saved. This progress will include statistics that show how 
		many questions users have gotten correct in each math category with their respective difficulty 
		settings.</p>
		<p>The quickfire nature that the questions can be answered in help to make the answers to certain
		simple maths equations instinctual for students which is a great skill to have in life. Being 
		able to know the answer to all multiplication questions that go up to the number 12 make solving
		math questions much faster than always relying on your calculator to find out what 9 times 7 is.</p>
		<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
		<p>Tools and Technologies: As I stated earlier in the report, I am knowledgeable in python with 
		some knowledge in HTML. However, both these programming languages are not ideal for developing 
		apps for mobile phones. Therefore, I will be using MIT App Inventor. MIT App Inventor was created 
		11 years ago as a straightforward way for anyone to make mobile apps without needing great 
		expertise. There are 19 different programming languages that are supported with the main one 
		being Java which is what I will be using. The apps are all developed for phones that run on 
		android operating system.</p>
		<h3>Skills Required</h3>
		<p>I will need to be knowledgeable and proficient in Java to develop my app. Java is the language 
		that I chose to use MIT App Inventor with so I will obviously need to learn how to use Java. 
		Another skill that is required is a good sense of design to make the website visually appealing. 
		As I mentioned previously during the details section, it is important to make the app colourful 
		and exciting for kids or else they will not be motivated to use the app.</p>
		<h3>Outcome</h3>
		<p>If the project is successful, I will have created an app that will help many children in 
		becoming proficient at maths. Additionally, these children may enjoy maths if the app is fun 
		to them which is positive as many children find maths incredibly boring. There is currently only 
		one app that is like my idea and it is available on the iOS app store. My idea isn’t the first 
		time that this type of app has been thought of, so my project is not completely unique. In the 
		end, my app can be a way that parents and teachers can trust to teach their children important 
		mathematics skills.</p>
